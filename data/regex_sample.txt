The tidyverse is a collection of open source R packages introduced by Hadley Wickham and his team that "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures" of tidy data. Characteristic features of tidyverse packages include massive use of non-standard evaluation and encouraging piping. The core packages are ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats, which provide functionality to model, transform, and visualize data. An additional 12 packages assist the core. As of November 2018, the tidyverse package and some of its individual packages comprise 5 out of the top 10 most downloaded R packages. The tidyverse is the subject of multiple books and papers

Critics of the tidyverse have argued it promotes tools that are harder to teach and learn than their base-R equivalents and are too dis-similar to other programming languages
